Key Insights:

For the presentation, I focus first on the difference in usage of the service between genders.
In the later plots I'll show the difference in usage between customers and subscribers.
Then i will add more variables that influences the results, such as age and week of the day.

Findings:

During the analysis, I found that the users of the service were largely males (75%) followed by female (23%) and other genders (2%).

The mean distance for each travel is 1.48 km with an average duration of 11 minutes. The most common stations are  Market St at 10th ST and San Francisco Caltrain Station 2.

Subscribers mostly use the service on Monday through Friday (maybe becouse they use the service to go to work), while customer uses the service more occasionally; All genders follow this trend.

A line graph shows that the oldest riders had the greatest fluctuation between the shortest and longest rides.
The "other gender" category had the most outliers in the data.
